# Prerequisites

All the examples and training are done in Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS Desktop (64-bit) which you can download [here](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads). The installation is very easy and I would recommend to make a fresh install without partitions. 
If you are not familiar with Linux, this is great place to start [flashing the Ubuntu ISO from Windows](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows) in a USB Stick.
